# Real-Time Multiagent Pathfinding
This repository contains an Unreal Engine 4 plugin for multiagent pathfinding in real time. 
That means that if you apply this plugin in your project you will be able to have AI agents with different shapes 
and speed values planning paths together and replanning when new agents arrive or old ones dissapear.

The repository is on reconstruction right now and more details will be added later.
For now, please refer to a visual presentation - https://youtu.be/ZANt1uHhGTY?si=QWy76DyG5KaDWIJD.
